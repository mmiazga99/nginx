# nginx.conf
Hi, this is my nginx.conf file, which was made with the help of:
- https://www.nginx.com/blog/performance-tuning-tips-tricks/
- https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/recipes/wordpress/
- https://www.udemy.com/course/the-perfect-nginx-server-ubuntu-edition/
- https://www.udemy.com/course/nginx-fundamentals/
- just googling a lot of stuff.

This config file is being used for my LEMP + Wordpress website.<br/>
I will be updating it, if I find something else worth implementing.<br/>
Feel free to use :D
